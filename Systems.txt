Mech

  Terms:
    Point to Point
      A system that connects objects together, directly.
      Allows bypass.

    Linear
      A system that connects objects through a series of tubes.
      Does not allow bypass.

    Fluid based
      When damaged, will leak fluid, rate increases if in use.
      If all fluid is lost, system is rendered inoperable.

    Pressure based
      When damaged, function stops.

  Core Systems:
    Electrics
      Point to Point FAST transmission
      Tied to engine

    Hydraulics
      Linear SLOW transmission
      Tied to engine
      Fluid based

    Pneumatics
      Linear SLOW transmission
      Tied to engine
      Pressure based
