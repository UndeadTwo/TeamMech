Click based object interaction
  * Raycast from camera to world collision space

View can be transfered to cameras outside of mech

Actions inside of the mech affect the Mech in Worldspace
  * Players change speed, direction
  * Players traverse and fire main gun
  * Players mount and fire machine guns

Actions outside of the mech can affect the inside of the Mech
  * Armor penetration can kill players or disrupt and destroy subsystems
    * Ammo cache can be detonated
    * Fuel can be lit
    * Pneumatics can be broken
    * Hydraulics can be pierced
    * Electrics can be shot

Armor system that has some authenticity
  * Shells can pierce armor or bounce
  * Penetration chance is linked to hit angle and shell angle
    * A shell that hits perpendicular and dead on will be almost guaranteed to penetrate armor.
    * Shells that hit side-on will almost definitely bounce off

Characters that can carry small arms
  * Allied and Enemy variants
  * Crew outside of the mech
    * Players should be able to leave the mech
      * For fires
      * When damaged beyond field-repair
      * When recrewing the mech
  * Infantry
    * While not strictly a combined arms game, representation of the poor bastards beating hooves should be present.
  * Mech-Busters (Climbing gear?)
    * A well entrenched mech makes a hell of a target for other mechs, but infantry can make it pop

Mech subsystems
  * Electronics
    * Lights
    * Radio
  * Pneumatics
    * Item delivery system for ammunition or other small portable objects
  * Hydraulics
    * Pressurized fluid lines for articulation of legs and traversal of the main gun
  * Fluids
    * Fuel lines
    * Coolant lines
